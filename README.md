# 3rd-Year-Game

Final year game for my degree Games Technology, as was submitted on the deadline. This means that it's pretty messy and may have a few bugs (although we tried to eliminate as many as possible!).

Using raw DirectX11, libcurl and SFML, Colour Space was made by two of us from September 2014 until Early May 2015. The entire game was redone in February as we lost two team members and decided to go 2D. 

The biggest strengths of the project would be the Fluid system alongside the caching system. A great deal of work was put into that to make it as efficient as we could make it.

There is a readme included in the ReleaseBuild zip that details controls and which version of the game to run.
